# 💼 Banking Risk Analytics Project

This project focuses on building a basic understanding of "risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector", using a combination of Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboards. It demonstrates how financial institutions can use data to reduce the risk of lending to non-creditworthy customers.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

---

## 💡 Solution

I developed an interactive dashboard using the latest Power BI tools that helps decision-makers assess an applicant’s profile and risk category. Based on key indicators such as income, age, loan amount, and credit score, the dashboard helps determine:
- Whether the applicant is likely to repay the loan
- Whether the loan should be approved or declined

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure of financial datasets and loan applications
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python
- Prepare a refined dataset for visualization
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard for loan risk analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python – Data cleaning & EDA (`Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`)
- Power BI – Dashboard creation & data storytelling
- Jupyter Notebook – For documenting the analysis process
- CSV– As the data format


---

## 🔍 Key Features of the Dashboard

- Customer Risk Segmentation– Visual grouping of high-risk vs. low-risk applicants
- Loan Approval Likelihood – Based on age, income, and credit history
- Demographic Insights – Age group and occupation trends among borrowers
- Loan Amount Analysis – Trends by month, region, and approval status

---

## 📌 Outcomes

- Business users can assess loan applications with higher confidence.
- The dashboard helps reduce loan defaults by flagging risky applicants early.
- It provides a fast, visual way to derive insights from customer data.
